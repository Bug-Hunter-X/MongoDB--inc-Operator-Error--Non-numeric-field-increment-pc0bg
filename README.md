# MongoDB $inc Operator Error
This example demonstrates an error that arises when attempting to use the `$inc` operator in MongoDB with a non-numeric field. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value. If the field is not numeric, the operation will fail silently and won't update the field as intended.

## Bug
The bug occurs when `$inc` is used on a field that doesn't contain a number. This can result in unexpected behavior and data inconsistencies.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the field you're trying to increment is of the correct data type (a number). Before the update operation, check the field type or cast it to a number if needed.  Alternatively, use a different update operator for non-numeric fields.
